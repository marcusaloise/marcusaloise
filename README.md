I'm Marcus Vinicius Aloise Teixeira, an Observability and SRE/DevOps enthusiast committed to building a solid career in this constantly evolving field. I am currently in the final stages of my degree and consider myself a self-taught professional, highly focused on learning and developing relevant skills in this field.

Throughout my academic career, I acquired solid knowledge in Observability and SRE/DevOps, with emphasis on the following technical skills:

- Python: I have knowledge in Python
- Linux: I have experience in Linux environments, being able to configure, manage and troubleshoot Linux operating systems, ensuring the stability and availability of services.
- AWS: I have knowledge of the platform and studying to get my solutions architect certificates.
- Power BI: I have advanced skills in Power BI, allowing me to create dashboards and data visualizations to assist in decision-making based on accurate and up-to-date information.
- Terraform and Ansible: I use Terraform and Ansible to automate the provisioning and configuration of infrastructures, streamlining the deployment of systems and ensuring consistency in configurations.
- Docker and Kubernetes: I have experience in creating and managing Docker containers, as well as in orchestrating clusters with Kubernetes, facilitating application deployment and scalability.

I am looking for an opportunity to apply and expand these skills in Observability and SRE/DevOps, contributing to the success of the team and the organization as a whole. My goal is to develop innovative solutions that drive operational efficiency and systems quality.
